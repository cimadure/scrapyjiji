This tool has been inspired by the scrapy crawler [kijiji_scraper](https://github.com/mfournierca/kijiji_scraper).
It is not intended to be generic but can be easily adapted to fit your needs.

The scraper is based on the [scrapy framework](http://scrapy.org) to retrieve attributes like the title, address and price of an ad.
The kijiji start url should use the english locale setting to be scraped.

The geocoding is based on the [geocoder module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geocoder) and uses the following geocoding services: google, osm, mapquest.
Take a look at the geocoder providers informations to know limits of each services (for example mapquest requires an API key).

The map is generated using the [folium module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/folium) with the default setting to use the openstreetmap tile.

#### Prerequisites:
This script works on Python 3.

**Packages requirements**:
* scrapy v1.1.0
* geocoder v1.15.0
* folium v0.2.1

Each packages can be install using pip:

#### How it works:
